application/hypermedia+json
===========================

This is the working draft for the 'application/hypermedia+json' media type.

The objectives of the media type are:

1) To add hypermedia controls to 'application/json' [RFC 4627]
2) Allow extension of those media controls
3) Document the grammar for the hypermedia controls in ABNF such that it
   can be referenced / imported from other media types
4) Limit its reach to these objectives i.e. not wander into collections etc
